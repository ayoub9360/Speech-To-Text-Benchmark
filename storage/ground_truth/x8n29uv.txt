Uber CEO has accidentally revealed that he doesn't know how much rides cost on his own app.
In an interview with Wired, Dara Khosrowshahi was asked how much he thought a 3-mile Uber ride in New York costs.
His answer was 20 bucks before being told the total was $50 and the CEO was shocked.
Khosrowshahi responded with “oh my god, wow”.
And that was before he found out the $50 was on the lower end due to surge pricing.
Surge pricing is when prices increase for goods or services during peak demand times.
So sometimes a 3-mile ride in New-York in an Uber can cost an upward of $70 and data suggests that Uber's prices are continuing to rise.
Khosrowshahi addressed this issue saying everything is more expensive, inflation has become a part of our everyday lives.
He also mentioned that Uber is seeing audience growth so while prices are higher he said it certainly hasn't hurt the business.
